Yoga has been around for a few thousand years and has many branches and disciplines. As a natural extension of this historical presence, and developed a mystery and suspense - especially for a newcomer to Yoga. In this post, I will bust some common myths, explore the benefits, and provide the general rules to follow before starting a Yoga practice.

## Yoga Mythbusters
### #1 - You must be flexible to do Yoga.
**Yoga** helps you become flexible. It does not require that you are flexible before you start. Everyone can start Yoga and progress at their pace. 

### #2 - You must not have any medical conditions to take up Yoga.
Yoga, like any other exercise, should be taken up with care if you have specific medical conditions. Everyone at any stage can follow ome Yoga postures and breathing exercises. Many Yoga techniques help to improve medical ailments. 

### #3 - Yoga is all about poses.
Good Yoga practice is a combination of breathing exercies (*pranayama*), physical poses (*asanas*) and meditation techniques (*dhyana*).

### #4 - You must go shopping before you start Yoga.
While Yoga Mats, Yoga Pants, and Yoga suits are all the rave in marketing, you can do Yoga without these. You work with your breath, body weight, and your mind - you do not need any other equipment. 
**Yoga Mats** provide a non-slippery partially cushioned surface. While a yoga mat can help, any non-slippery, lightly cushioned mat would work. Some alternatives are: Beach Towel, Woven Blankets / Comforters, Bath Mat, or non-Slippery bedsheet on a carpet floor. You can also do Yoga on grass, sand if you are outside. Yoga outside is especially great for breathing exercises.
**Yoga Clothing** - any loose and comfortable clothing works well for Yoga. It is best to wear clothing that can be tied at the waist - to avoid slips.

### #5 - Yoga preaches Hinduism.
Stone seals found from Indus Valley Civilization depicting figure seated in traditional Yoga pose place Yoga's existence around 3000 BC. Yoga practice does not include any preaching. The only vocal sound made during Yoga is "OM" - a two-syllable word that generates vibrations in your body and calms your mind. During meditation, you choose what you want to meditate upon.
